# NeuralNetworkEmotionRecognition
I've always thought it was interesting that we can't emotionally interact with our devices. I created an emotion recognition project that was trained using images scrubbed from Google images. I continually work to make this better. I would like to acquire a more versatile dataset and that will be my next project.
